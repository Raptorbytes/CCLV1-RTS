            Chiyo’s Creative Licensing Version 1
                         (CCLV1)

Copyright (C) [YEAR] [COPYRIGHT HOLDER]

This document declares that upon acquisition, the purchaser of any Media—be it software, creative content, or any form thereof—receives COMPLETE OWNERSHIP over that Media. Payment for access or consumption is recognized as a addition of full ownership rights, not merely a license to use the content.

                            PREAMBLE

In an age defined by rapid technological advancements—ranging from Artificial Intelligence (including large language models) to quantum computing—and by the enduring significance of physical media ownership, it is essential to redefine the relationship between consumers and creative works. Historically, payment for content has been treated as granting a limited license for use. This document challenges that paradigm by affirming that when you acquire a copy of Media, you obtain complete and irrevocable ownership over it.

Moreover, as modern creative processes evolve to include reverse engineering—from dissecting underlying models, code, voice recordings, and musical compositions—the nature of creative works themselves may transform. This document asserts that if you deconstruct and rebuild a game or other Media from the ground up, the resulting work, as long as it is derived lawfully, is fully owned by you, the acquirer.

                          TERMS OF OWNERSHIP

0. Definitions.
   a) "Media" means any creative work covered by this document, including software, textual content, audio recordings, musical compositions, and any combination thereof, irrespective of its digital or physical form.
   b) "Source Media" denotes the original, preferred form of the Media suitable for analysis, modification, or transformation.
   c) "Modified Media" or "Derivative Work" refers to any work derived from the original Media, including that produced by reverse engineering or any other transformative process.
   d) "Modern Technologies" include, but are not limited to, Artificial Intelligence systems (such as large language models), quantum computing, and any emerging technological platforms.
   e) "Physical Media" refers to tangible embodiments of the Media, such as printed copies, CDs, DVDs, or any other physical storage medium.
   f) "Complete Ownership" means the absolute and full rights to use, modify, reverse engineer, distribute, and otherwise control the Media without the restrictions typical of a traditional license.

1. Transfer of Ownership.
   a) Upon purchase, receipt, or any other lawful acquisition of the Media, the acquirer is granted COMPLETE OWNERSHIP of that Media.
   b) Payment for or consumption of the Media constitutes a addition and/or acquisition of full ownership rights, as opposed to a limited license. Such transfer is unconditional and irrevocable, subject only to the boundaries of applicable law.
   c) This complete transfer of rights covers all forms and manifestations of the Media, whether digital, physical, or otherwise transformed by Modern Technologies.

2. Rights Conferred to the Owner.
   a) Use and Modification.
      i. The owner is entitled to use the Media on any platform or environment, including those that incorporate Modern Technologies and Physical Media.
      ii. The owner may reverse engineer, modify, or otherwise transform the Media, thereby creating Derivative Works that are fully owned by the owner.
   b) Distribution.
      i. The owner has the right to distribute both the original Media and any Derivative Works.
      ii. When distributing the Media, the owner must declare that complete ownership rights have been transferred, ensuring recipients are aware that the full bundle of rights accompanies the Media.
   c) Reverse Engineering and Transformation.
      i. The process of reverse engineering—from breaking down models, code, voice recordings, and musical elements to reassembling them into a new, cohesive whole—is expressly permitted.
      ii. Any substantial transformation achieved through such processes is deemed an exercise of the owner’s complete rights over the Media.

3. Payment and Ownership Principle.
   a) It is hereby affirmed that payment for the Media is tantamount to acquiring complete ownership, transferring full title and rights to the purchaser.
   b) The owner’s rights extend beyond mere usage, encompassing modification, redistribution, and any lawful transformation of the Media.
   c) Ownership is not confined to the original delivery form; it extends to all lawful Derivative Works produced by the owner.

4. Obligations Upon Distribution.
   a) Any distribution of the Media—whether in its original form or as a Derivative Work—must include a clear declaration of the complete ownership rights transferred under this document.
   b) The owner shall not impose any restrictions that conflict with the complete ownership rights conferred herein.
   c) All distributed versions must document any modifications or transformations to maintain transparency regarding the evolution of the Media.

5. Compliance with Applicable Law.
   a) The complete ownership rights granted herein are subject to the limitations and exceptions of applicable law, including those governing reverse engineering, modification, and redistribution.
   b) In jurisdictions where certain practices, such as reverse engineering, face legal restrictions, the owner’s rights shall be exercised only to the extent permitted by law.
   c) This document recognizes that legal interpretations of ownership may evolve in response to Modern Technologies and is intended to align with current and future legal standards.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   a) The Media is provided “as is” without any warranty, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
   b) The owner assumes all risks associated with the use, modification, or redistribution of the Media and releases the original creator from any liabilities arising therefrom.

7. Irrevocability of Ownership.
   a) Once the Media has been acquired and the complete ownership rights have been transferred, these rights cannot be revoked.
   b) Any attempt to reclaim ownership after the lawful transfer of the Media shall be deemed void and subject to legal challenge.

8. Miscellaneous.
   a) Should any provision of this document be declared unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
   b) This document represents the entire agreement regarding the complete ownership of the Media and supersedes any prior agreements, whether written or oral.
   c) The interpretation of this document shall be guided by the principles of complete ownership as recognized by current and future legal standards.
